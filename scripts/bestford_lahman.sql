--1. What range of years for baseball games played does the provided database cover? 

SELECT MAX(year) AS last_year, MIN(year) AS first_year --used home_games for table, used alias to create columns to help identify
FROM homegames

--2. Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played? --- EddieGaedel 43 St. Louis Browns 1

SELECT p.playerid, CONCAT(p.namefirst,p.namelast), p.height, t.name, a.g_all  ----CONCAT names, joining ON tables is important and reflects in your answers
FROM people AS p
INNER JOIN appearances AS a
ON p.playerid = a.playerid
INNER JOIN teams AS t
ON t.teamid = a.teamid
ORDER BY height
LIMIT 1;


--3.Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

--4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

SELECT 
	CASE     ----using case statement, IF WHEN to identify abrvs and rename them
		WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'  ---using = because single abrv
		WHEN pos IN ('SS','1B','2B','3B') THEN 'Infield'  ----able to put multi abrvs in parenthesis. Have to use IN because of multiple abrv
		WHEN pos IN ('P','C') THEN 'Battery'
END AS positions_played---naming column
,COUNT(*)AS putouts_count
FROM fielding
WHERE yearid = '2016'
GROUP BY 
	CASE 
		WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'  
		WHEN pos IN ('SS','1B','2B','3B') THEN 'Infield' 
		WHEN pos IN ('P','C') THEN 'Battery'
		END;


--5. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?

SELECT G AS games, ROUND(AVG(SO),2) AS avg_strikeouts, (yearid)/10*10 AS decade, ROUND(AVG(HR),2) AS avg_homeruns
FROM teams
WHERE yearid >= 1920
GROUP BY games, decade
ORDER BY decade DESC;
