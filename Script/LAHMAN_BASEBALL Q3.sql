-- 4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position:
--  label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", 
-- and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery".
--  Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

	     WHEN f.pos = 'SS' OR f.pos = '1B' OR f.pos = '2B' OR f.pos = '3B' THEN 'Infield'
